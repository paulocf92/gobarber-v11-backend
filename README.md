# GoBarber v11 (Backend)

This is the backend for GoBarber app v11. It features a Node server with TypeScript, TypeORM (Postgres, MongoDB) for database management, Redis for queuing/dispatching processes, Jest for testing, DDD pattern with Dependency Injection (heavy SOLID enforcement with `tsyringe`), email sending, file storage, and much more.

This app is the conclusion of Rocketseat's bootcamp version 11, which was heavily rebuilt focusing on modern design patterns with TypeScript.
